This is a training project to create my own version of Git that I, with inspiration, have named "Duh." 

I am following a guide to implement basic commands from Git into my own version during my journey on learning how to program. Over time, I will add more things and experiment.

#### Available commands:
'init' - Usage: 'duh init' will initialize the existing folder that you are in. 'duh init repo' will create the 'repo' folder and initialize it.
